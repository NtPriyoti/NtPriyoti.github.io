        <h2>Batting Excellency</h2>
        <p>
          <b>2</b> - Shakib is just the second player with the double of 40-plus runs and over four wickets in a T20 World Cup game.
          Dwayne Bravo became the first player when he backed up his four-wicket haul with an unbeaten 66 against India in 2009 at Lord's.

        <h2>T20 World Cup</h2>
        <p>
          <b>2</b> - Previous instances of Shakib scoring 40-plus runs and taking four or more wickets in the same T20I - against Zim'13 and WI'18.
          While Shakib now has three such all-round efforts, no player has achieved it more him in men's T20Is.
